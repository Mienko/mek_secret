Secret is a gridless, one-column theme with large post thumbnails and pulled alignments. It is based on [the Underscores theme](http://underscores.me/).

It is fully responsive, and shines both on small pocket-sized devices and large screen computers. On screen sizes that allow it, it's left and right aligned elements (like pictures or blockquotes) are pulled *off the chart* to make more out of the extra screen real estate without diverting attention to ads, related articles or _other stuff_.

Secret's source files are available at GitHub, look for [Mienko/mek_secret](//github.com/Mienko/mek_secret/).
